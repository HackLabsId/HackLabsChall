Dear my precious one,  		 	   	   	 	      
	 	    		     	       	   	  	     	     
Baby, I am in the middle of cold war and I couldn't visit you at the moment. I'm so sorry
that it's been a week since I sent you my last letter this month. Hopefully the condition
will be fine, and I hope the President and the Commander will make the right decision of
not attacking Saint Bahreum, Switzerland.   			 	 
   	 		    	  	    	     	     	    	     
How's Eleanor? Is she okay? I heard that a mysterious disease appeared in our lovely town.
I hope both of you won't make any contacts to the outsiders.       	    
Things just make me really confuse about what's happening now.
