We need your help immediately. Apollo36 has just launched 20 minutes
ago with its brand new turbo flight rocket-machine and we lost its contact.

10 minutes before the interrupted signals, we received this weird 
transmission sounds from the nearest orbit of the rocket. It's very
impossible to hear the trumpets-likely sound from the sky, or is it
a very large sound that can't be detected by a mere humans?

Hint: I heard from the expertise that the transmission that was used has 
these following frequencies:


Band	        Frequency	                Sideband
80 meters	3.845 MHz (3.73 in Europe)	LSB
43 meters	6.925 MHz (Pirate Radio)	USB
40 meters	7.17 MHz (7.165 in Europe)	LSB
20 meters	14.23 MHz	                USB
15 meters	21.34 MHz	                USB
10 meters	28.68 MHz	                USB
11 meters	27.7 MHz (Pirate Radio)	        USB


They called it Slow Scan Television. :) ...
