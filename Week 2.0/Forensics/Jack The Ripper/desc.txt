It's already been a week since the woman in red
died.

A strange enigma have made the town feel frightened
as a strange human-figure convinced me and Sherlock that
he comes from the future.
He managed to go back to 18th Century to collect a lot 
of informations about the death of the woman in red. He has
a lot of sophisticated tools like 'foremost' in order to
recover a broken images, which believed taken by the forensics teams.

At that time, the figures's world is attacked by a cyber-attack virus
called ILOVEYOU.
This virus can overwrite a single files within a minute, and luckily
the images of the woman in red was taken when the accident happen, and it is NOT 
OVERWRITTEN.
If you can recover the files correctly, we might get the next clues to
the death of the woman in red.

The strange figures believed that the killer IS NOT the zodiac killer, 
he just imitates the way that he kills.

Can you help us again?

Hint #1 : Use a carving tools or do a manual carve to get the files.

Hint #2 : The ILOVEYOU virus have a header that starts with \xc6\x32\xa3\x87\x76 and so on.
          There are 3 evidences files which are two pictures and one .gif files.

Hint #3 : Altough the ILOVEYOU virus managed to attack all the three files,
          the strange figure told us that at the END OF JUNKDATAS of the virus
          , it leaves a mark "ILOVEYOU" strings. However, additional datas after the
          "ILOVEYOU" strings will be changed by a random common strings.
          When you've carved the files correctly, you may notice that the file signatures
          are CHANGED because of the virus.
