Annoyed by the woman in red before, Sherlock and I kept following her
until she disappeared.
On the next day, a crowd just popped out from nowhere looking at a trail of blood
that leads to a corpse near the harbour. It is the woman in red.

When the forensics team arrived, they found a small USB that contains a few files.
Sherlock and I never saw that files before, can you help us?

Hint #2: Guido van Rossum might helps you in this case.
