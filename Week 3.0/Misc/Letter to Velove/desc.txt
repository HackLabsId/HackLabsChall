Bucky, has been deployed to Russia to take
another mission from the President. In order to
make sure everything's okay so his wife will not be worried,
he always sends her a letter regularly. But one day,
when his wife, Velove sent the replied-letter back to
him, he's confused because all the contents of the letter
are pretty much the same as the one he sent to her.

Hint #1: There's something weird in the letter. Look at those
         spaces .., probably there are a hidden message (?).

HInt #2: She told him last time that he probably need his name in
         lowercase. It's a password for him. Hmm ... it's a "little bit snowy" down here.
